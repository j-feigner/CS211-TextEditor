The Judgement of Paris

King Priam and Queen Hecuba ruled the city of Troy. While she was pregnant, Hecuba dreamed that her baby would cause the destruction of the royal family and of Troy. 
So when the baby boy was born, Priam gave his son to a shepherd and told the shepherd to abandon the baby on a mountain.
The shepherd did as he was told. When he returned to the mountain a few days later, he found the baby was still alive. So he kept it and raised it as his own. 
He called the boy Paris.
Paris grew up, got married, and lived as a shepherd, just like his adoptive father. He was strong and handsome. He did not know he was the king's son. 
He lived happily until the day he became involved in an argument among three goddesses. The argument began because Eris, the goddess of discord, was not invited to a wedding feast. 
She had been purposely excluded because of her history of causing disagreements, and she wanted revenge. Eris wrote "For the fairest" on a golden apple and threw it onto the table at the wedding feast. 
Every goddess at the feast claimed the apple as her own. Eventually, the competition was narrowed down to three: 
Hera, the queen of the gods; 
Athena, the goddess of wisdom; 
and Aphrodite, the goddess of love. 
The king of the gods, Zeus, was called to choose the fairest from among these three. Zeus knew that no matter which goddess he chose, the others would be angry. So, he asked young Paris to make the choice.
The three goddesses tried to bribe Paris. Hera promised him great wealth and power. Athena promised wisdom and success in battle. 
Then Aphrodite whispered to him, "Choose me, and I will give you the most beautiful woman in the world as your wife."
Paris, forgetting he already had a wife, chose Aphrodite. 


Morning - Poem by Billy Collins

Why do we bother with the rest of the day,
the swale of the afternoon,
the sudden dip into evening,

then night with his notorious perfumes,
his many-pointed stars?

This is the best-
throwing off the light covers,
feet on the cold floor,
and buzzing around the house on espresso-

maybe a splash of water on the face,
a palmful of vitamins-
but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,

dictionary and atlas open on the rug,
the typewriter waiting for the key of the head,
a cello on the radio,

and, if necessary, the windows-
trees fifty, a hundred years old
out there,
heavy clouds on the way
and the lawn steaming like a horse
in the early morning.
